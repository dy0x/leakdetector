# Early Water Leak Detection in Household Appliances
This was my final year capstone/thesis project to complete my Bachelor of Electrical Engineering Honours.

It  measures the water flow rate of a hall-effect flow meter, and if a drop in flow rate is detected (i.e. a leak), then it will shut off the solenoid valve. It is controlled by an ESP32 DevKit V1. This code is only a small part of the overall undertaking of research and synthesis, and it's intended only as a proof of concept. I want to keep this up for archival purposes.
