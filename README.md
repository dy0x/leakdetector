# Early Water Leak Detection in Household Appliances
This was my final year capstone/thesis project to complete my Bachelor of Electrical Engineering Honours.

It measures the water flow rate of a hall-effect flow meter, and if a drop in flow rate is detected (i.e. a leak), then it will shut off the solenoid valve.
